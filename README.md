# File Encryption and HMAC Generation

This repository combines both frontend and backend components for performing file encryption and generating Hash-based Message Authentication Codes (HMACs). The application provides a user-friendly interface for securely encrypting files and verifying their integrity using HMACs.
  
## Introduction

The goal of this repository is to provide a comprehensive solution for encrypting files and ensuring their integrity using HMACs. The frontend offers an intuitive user interface for file selection, encryption, and HMAC generation. Meanwhile, the backend performs the cryptographic operations, including encryption and HMAC computation.

## Features

- **File Encryption**: Encrypt files using a secure encryption algorithm.
- **HMAC Generation**: Generate HMACs for encrypted files to ensure data integrity.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: REACT
- **Backend**: Python

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/burakbinmunir/File-Encryption.git`
2. **Frontend Setup**: Navigate to the `frontend` directory and follow the setup instructions in the respective README file.
3. **Backend Setup**: Navigate to the `backend` directory and follow the setup instructions in the respective README file.
4. **Run the Application**: Start both frontend and backend servers according to their setup instructions.

## Usage

1. Open the application in a web browser.
2. Choose the file you want to encrypt using the frontend interface.
3. Initiate the encryption process.
4. Upon successful encryption, you can download the encrypted file. 
5. Decrypt the file whenever required using the application from `File decryption` tab.
6. You may generate the hmac from `Generate HMAC` tab.
